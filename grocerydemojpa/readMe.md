# Spring Boot Gradle Application with JPA and H2 Database

## Overview

This is a sample Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to use Gradle as a build tool, integrate with JPA (Java Persistence API), and use H2 as an in-memory database.

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Gradle
- Your favorite IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```shell

```

### Navigate to the project directory

```shell
cd ser421public/serverside/Spring/grocerydemojpa
```

### Build the project

```shell
gradle clean build
```

Or, if you have a Gradle wrapper:

```shell
./gradlew clean build
```

### Running the application

```shell
gradle bootRun
```

Or using the Gradle wrapper:

```shell
